## üìñ How to Use

Maximize the potential of the Leaf Area Calculator with these easy steps:

1. **Prepare Your Leaves**: Place each leaf on a plain white piece of paper, ensuring they do not overlap.
2. **Scan**: Digitally scan your prepared leaves, capturing their essence for analysis.
3. **Input**: Input the folder containing your scanned images into the application.

### Important Notes:

- **Background**: The white paper serves as a crucial contrast background. Only use plain white paper without any other objects or materials present.
- **Accuracy**: The app distinguishes leaf areas by contrasting against the white background. Ensure no other items are on the paper to avoid inaccurate measurements.
